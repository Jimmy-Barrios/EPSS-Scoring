# EPSS Vulnerability Analyzer

## Overview

The EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) Vulnerability Analyzer is a WordPress plugin that allows security professionals and website administrators to analyze CVE vulnerabilities using the EPSS scoring system. This tool provides probability-based risk assessment for vulnerabilities, helping users prioritize security efforts based on the likelihood of exploitation.

## Features

- **CVE Lookup**: Enter any CVE ID to retrieve detailed information
- **EPSS Score Analysis**: View probability-based risk scores and percentile rankings 
- **Vulnerability Profile**: Visualize attack vectors through an interactive radar chart
- **CVSS Integration**: Compare EPSS scores with traditional CVSS severity ratings
- **NIST References**: View relevant references from the NIST National Vulnerability Database
- **Dark Theme**: Modern, sleek interface designed for security professionals
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.6 or higher
- PHP 7.2 or higher
- JavaScript enabled in the browser

## Installation

### Automatic Installation (Recommended)

1. Log in to your WordPress dashboard
2. Navigate to "Plugins" → "Add New"
3. Search for "EPSS Vulnerability Analyzer"
4. Click "Install Now" and then "Activate"

### Manual Installation

1. Download the plugin ZIP file
2. Log in to your WordPress dashboard
3. Navigate to "Plugins" → "Add New"
4. Click "Upload Plugin" at the top of the page
5. Choose the downloaded ZIP file and click "Install Now"
6. After installation completes, click "Activate Plugin"

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. After installation, add the EPSS Analyzer to any page or post using the shortcode:
   ```
   [epss_analyzer]
   ```

2. The shortcode will display a search form where users can enter a CVE ID.

3. Enter a valid CVE ID in the format `CVE-YYYY-NNNNN` (e.g., `CVE-2021-44228`).

4. Click "Analyze" to retrieve and display the vulnerability information.

### Interpreting Results

The analysis results include:

- **EPSS Score**: The probability (0-100%) that the vulnerability will be exploited in the next 30 days
- **Percentile**: How the vulnerability ranks compared to all other known vulnerabilities
- **CVSS Score**: The Common Vulnerability Scoring System rating (0-10)
- **Vulnerability Profile**: A radar chart showing the attack vector characteristics
- **References**: Links to technical details and additional information from NIST

### Tips for Best Results

- Use the most recent CVE IDs for the most accurate EPSS scores
- Compare the EPSS score with the CVSS score to get a complete picture of risk
- Check the references section for detailed technical information about the vulnerability
- Use the vulnerability profile to understand potential attack vectors

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **CVE Not Found**: Ensure you've entered the correct CVE ID format (CVE-YYYY-NNNNN)
- **No Data Displayed**: Some newer CVEs may not have EPSS data available yet
- **API Connection Errors**: Check your server's outbound connection to api.first.org
- **JavaScript Errors**: Ensure your theme is not blocking the loading of Chart.js

### Debug Mode

To enable debug mode:

1. Add `?epss_debug=1` to the URL of the page containing the EPSS analyzer
2. Check your browser's console for detailed error messages
3. Use the "Test Connection" feature in the debug mode to verify API connectivity

## Customization

### CSS Customization

The plugin includes built-in dark theme styling. To customize the appearance:

1. Add custom CSS in your theme's customizer
2. Target the EPSS analyzer containers with these selectors:
   - `.epss-analyzer-container` - Main container
   - `.epss-results` - Results container
   - `.epss-modern-score-panel` - Score panels
   - `.epss-vector-panel` - Vulnerability profile panel
