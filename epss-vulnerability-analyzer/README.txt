Analyze CVE vulnerabilities using the EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) to assess the likelihood of exploitation in the next 30 days.

== Description ==

The EPSS Vulnerability Analyzer is a WordPress plugin that allows you to analyze CVE vulnerabilities using the FIRST.org EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) API. The plugin provides a user-friendly interface to:

* Enter a CVE ID and retrieve its EPSS score
* Display the probability of exploitation in the next 30 days
* Show the percentile rank among all vulnerabilities
* Visualize the attack vector details in a radar chart
* Display detailed CVSS metrics

EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) is a data-driven effort that uses machine learning to predict the likelihood that a software vulnerability will be exploited in the wild.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `epss-vulnerability-analyzer` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place the shortcode `[epss_analyzer]` on any page or post where you want the analyzer to appear

== Usage ==

To use the EPSS Vulnerability Analyzer:

1. Add the shortcode `[epss_analyzer]` to any post or page
2. Enter a valid CVE ID in the format `CVE-YYYY-NNNNN` (e.g., CVE-2021-44228)
3. Click "Analyze" to retrieve and display the EPSS data
4. View the EPSS score, percentile, and attack vector visualization

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is EPSS? =

EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) is a data-driven effort to estimate the likelihood that a software vulnerability will be exploited in the wild. The EPSS score represents the probability that a vulnerability will be exploited within the next 30 days.

= Where does the data come from? =

The EPSS data is retrieved from the FIRST.org EPSS API at https://api.first.org/data/v1/epss. The attack vector details are retrieved from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) API.

= Does this plugin store any data? =

No, this plugin does not store any data. All data is retrieved in real-time from the EPSS and NVD APIs when a user requests information about a specific CVE.
